# Fake Product Reviews Identification System using Machine Learning

## Abstract
This thesis focuses on developing a system for identifying fake product reviews using machine learning techniques. The proposed system aims to analyze various features of product reviews to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. The ultimate goal is to provide consumers with a more reliable way to evaluate products online and maintain the trustworthiness of the e-commerce ecosystem.

## Introduction
The credibility of product reviews has been questioned due to the prevalence of fake reviews, which can deceive consumers and undermine the integrity of the review system. This thesis aims to develop a system for identifying fake product reviews using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
Machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree are used for detecting fake reviews. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve/AUC are used to assess the performance of the algorithms.

## Results and Analysis
The performance of machine learning algorithms on the dataset is measured using various evaluation metrics. Analysis of features most indicative of fake reviews helps improve the accuracy of the algorithms.

## Conclusion
The research contributes to identifying effective machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics for detecting fake reviews. Accurately identifying fake reviews can improve the reliability of product reviews, increase customer trust, and result in increased sales and customer satisfaction for e-commerce platforms.
